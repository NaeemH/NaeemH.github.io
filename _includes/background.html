      As a systems engineer, I identify &amp; automate technical debt, scale our systems to deal with a constantly changing set of problems, and write lots of config files. &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
